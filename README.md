# Model Mixins
- A mixing class can be viewed as an interface with implemented features.
- When a model extends a mixin it implements the interface and includes all fields, attributes, properties and methods.
- Model mixins are abstract model classes.
- All of the fields of these abstract classes are saved in the same database tables as the fields of the extending model.
